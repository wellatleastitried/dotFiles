# Arch Linux Configuration Files

These are the configuration files that I use in my Arch Linux setup. I will continue to update and add more configurations as I automate and modify my setup.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wellatleastitried/dotFiles.git
   cd dotFiles
   ```

2. **Run the install script:**

   The install script will need to be ran as root as it will be installing missing packages.
     ```bash
     chmod +x install.sh
     sudo ./install.sh
     ```

3. **Modify and Customize:**

   After installation, feel free to modify any of the configuration files according to your preferences. These files are intended to be a starting point and can be customized further based on your requirements.
