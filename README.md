# Arch Linux Configuration Files

These are the configuration files that I use in my Arch Linux setup. I will continue to update and add more configurations as I automate and modify my setup.

## Installation

To use these configuration files on your local system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wellatleastitried/dotFiles.git
   cd dotFiles
   ```

2. **Run the Makefile:**

   The Makefile includes targets for installing, updating, and configuring various aspects of your system. Here are some common targets:

   - **make:** Installs necessary dependencies, installs all configuration files, and sets up the environment.
     ```bash
     make all
     ```

3. **Modify and Customize:**

   After installation, feel free to modify any of the configuration files according to your preferences. These files are intended to be a starting point and can be customized further based on your requirements.
